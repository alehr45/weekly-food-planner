Our team split up the tasks to make this application

I (Alex) worked mainly on the layout and design aspects. I put together the html and basic javascript fetch functions.

Fraser implemented the moment JavaScriptÂ library which displays the current time and days of the week to make our calendar work functionally.

Dustin designed and created the drag and drop feature which adds much more functionality to the app.

We worked hard on this and we hope you enjoy it!
